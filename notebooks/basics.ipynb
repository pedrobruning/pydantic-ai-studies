      "The modern stock market traces its roots to **Amsterdam in 1602**, when the Dutch East India Company issued the first paper shares. This allowed the company to raise capital for its expensive voyages to Asia, and investors could buy and sell these shares on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange - the world's first official stock exchange.\n",

      "- The **Philadelphia Stock Exchange** was established in 1790\n",
      "- The **New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)** was founded in 1792 with the famous Buttonwood Agreement, where 24 stockbrokers met under a buttonwood tree on Wall Street\n",
